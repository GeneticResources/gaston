1.1: corrected C++ code (compilation errors on some distributions)
1.2: kinhsip matrix is now in single precision (faster) 
     various minor changes
1.3: corrected bug in HWE chi square (monomorphic SNP) 
     select.snps and select.inds (negative indices, presence of NAs)
1.3.1: suppressed various __attribute__ ((aligned(16))) in m4_kinship*.cpp
       which seemed to be causing an (intermittent) bug (?!)
1.4: introduced option gastion.auto.set.stats / updated vignette accordingly
     +hz in ped stats
     new function reshape.GRM
     as.bed.matrix no longer is a method, but a function
     minor modifs in read.vcf
     matrix4 now uses uint8_t array instead of char array (induced many 
     small changes in the C++ code).
1.4.5: corrected a bug in method 'show'
       better handling of constraints in AIREML methods 
       faster implementation of GRM
       new function of genomic.sex
